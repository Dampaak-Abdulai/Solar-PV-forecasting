# Solar-PV-forecasting
In my thesis work, the persistence model, random forest, and gradient boosting regressor models were used to produce deterministic and probabilistic predictions of solar power generation by using data collected over an eleven-month span. Data analytic techniques were used to understand the relationship between weather data and solar PV generation.
